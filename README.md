Object detection

project title:-
          Smart Ambulance System ðŸš‘
using Object Detection and Shortest Route Optimization 

The system is divided into five major models, each handling a specific task:

Model Name	
Purpose / Function	
Technologies Used

Model 1: Object Detection	Detects vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles, and road features (manholes/construction).	YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV

Model 2: GPS & Hospital Locator	Simulates ambulanceâ€™s GPS and identifies nearby hospitals in Kurnool.	Python

Model 3: Hazard Detection & Risk Analysis	Detects and stores coordinates of risky areas (open manholes, road construction).	YOLO/custom dataset simulation

Model 4: Route Optimization	Calculates shortest and safest route by avoiding hazard zones.	Dijkstra-like heuristic, Haversine distance

Model 5: IoT Emergency Communication	Sends emergency alerts to nearby traffic systems python
